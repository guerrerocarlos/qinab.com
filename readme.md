===============================================================================

This is just a very _alpha_ **proof of concept** for creating a super straight-forward way to edit blog posts and markdown or html files in general, as intuitively as editing a medium post 🚀.

Works pretty well so far, this very readme is being written in it using [this url](https://qinab.com/guerrerocarlos/qinab.com/blob/master/readme.md) that can be used as [demo](https://qinab.com/guerrerocarlos/qinab.com/blob/master/readme.md):

This way you can publish in your own hosted blog (free on [github.com](http://github.com)) and do it as easily as doing it in [medium.com](http://medium.com)

Only made possible thanks to [https://yabwe.github.io/medium-editor/](https://yabwe.github.io/medium-editor/)

Happy coding!
